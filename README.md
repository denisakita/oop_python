# OOP Project

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python. It
covers both basic and advanced features, showcasing how to define and use classes and objects to build complex and
modular programs.

## Core OOP Principles

Learn the basics of defining and using classes and objects in Python, which are essential for building complex and
modular programs. This project includes examples and exercises to help reinforce these concepts.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- Class and Object Creation
- Attributes and Methods
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Advanced OOP Features

Understand abstract base classes, interfaces, and multiple inheritance to create more flexible and reusable code. These
advanced features allow developers to design better systems that can evolve over time.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)
- Interfaces
- Multiple Inheritance
- Mixins

## Magic Methods and Data Classes

Discover unique Python features like magic methods for integrating classes with the language and data classes to reduce
boilerplate code. This section helps you leverage Python's capabilities for better class design.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- Magic Methods (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, etc.)
- Data Classes
- Operator Overloading
- Customizing Class Behavior

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install any required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denisakita/oop_project.git
cd oop_project
```

If you need to install specific packages, you can do so using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the examples and exercises included in this project, execute the relevant Python scripts. For instance, to run
the main OOP demonstration, you can use:

```bash
python main.py
```

Feel free to explore the different modules and examples provided to deepen your understanding of OOP in Python.
